# Project 2018
## Programming for Data Analysis

** Project Intentions **

* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which I can
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Detail my research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

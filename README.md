# Project 2018
## Programming for Data Analysis

**Project Intentions**

* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which I can collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

In this repository you will find my investigation. The body of my work is contained in the Jupyter notebook above; including all code, explanations and references. 

In this file you will find:
1. Information on how to download and save the ipynb notebook.
2. Instructions on how to open the notebook on your machine.
3. How to run code cells in an open ipynb notebook.

Alternatively you can view my Jupyter notebook, [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MarionMcG/python-fundamentals-project/blob/master/exam-cohort.ipynb).

### 1. Downloading an ipynb file from Github
* I'd recommend that you download or clone the entire repository with all of its dependencies, rather than just downloading the ipynb notebook. 

### 2. Opening an ipynb file on your machine
* Open a terminal, such as Command Prompt. I will be using [Cmdr.exe](http://cmder.net/), but it doesn't matter which command line interpreter you use. 
* You must have Python and Jupyter installed on your machine before you continue. Use command, 'jupyter -- version' and 'python --version' to determine this, and also to see which version is installed on your machine.

* If Jupyter Notebook is **not** installed, you should download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which supports Jupyter notebook files, and Python code. 
* Once Jupyter is installed, type the command, 'jupyter notebook' to open a static webpage displaying the folder you're currently in. You may need to copy and paste the URL (highlighted below) that appears on the command line, if a webpage doesn't automatically open.

**NOTE:** When opening Jupyter notebook, ensure the cloned repository is in a subdirectory of the folder you are in. 

* From the webpage, navigate to the folder containing your ipynb file and click to open in a new tab. 
* When you are finished, close all windows. In your terminal, to close Jupyter Notebook press Ctrl+C.

### 3. Running code from an ipynb file
Firstly as much of the code in this notebook is dependent on variables in previous cells, I would advise running all cells at the beginning. To do this, go to taskbar button Cell, and select Run All from the drop down menu. 

To run an individual code cell, you first need to be in command mode. In this mode there will be a blue line to the left of the cell. If you have selected a cell, but the line on the left is not blue, press Esc. 

Once in command mode, you can navigate up and down the notebook using arrow keys. 

You can also run an individual cell, by pressing Shift + Enter.
